    <h1>Title: Greetings!</h1>
    <img src="/images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Snigdha Samantaray" class="profile-image">
    <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Snigdha Samantaray, and I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the <a href="https://www.earth.miami.edu/">Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science</a>, University of Miami. My research realm is atmospheric sciences with a keen focus on the dynamics of moist convection in tropical weather.</p>

    <p>Currently, as part of my PhD, I am working with my advisor, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BFinK4UAAAAJ&hl=en">Brian Mapes</a>, to understand the moisture dynamics of Water Vapor Lakes in the Western Indian Ocean and their regional impacts on African Rainfall. We identify these events by a dynamical distinctive persistently precipitating high-column water vapor features over the ocean.</p>

    <p>Previously, I earned a BS-MS degree from the <a href="https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research</a> in Pune, specializing in Earth and Climate Sciences. During this time, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OBB5qd8AAAAJ&hl=en">Suhas Ettammal</a> on satellite data analysis to probe into the entrainment rates of tropical deep convective cloudsâ€”a critical factor for understanding convection's vertical and thermodynamic roles in climate models.</p>

    <p>My research interests are broad, spanning atmospheric moist-dynamical processes, Convective Self-Aggregation, tropical weather phenomena, and the intricate scale interactions within the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>You can find more details below about my work and research journey.</p>
